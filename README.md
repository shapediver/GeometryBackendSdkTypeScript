# ShapeDiver Geometry Backend API SDKs

[ShapeDiver](https://www.shapediver.com/) is a cloud platform for building online applications based
on parametric 3D files made with Rhinoceros 3D and Grasshopper.

Using the **ShapeDiver Geometry Backend API** allows accessing ShapeDiver models without using the
**ShapeDiver Viewer**.
The SDKs provide the functionality to communicate with a specific version of our Geometry Backend
API, and they expose all TypeScript-types describing request and response objects.

## Content
